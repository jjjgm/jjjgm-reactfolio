# jgm-reactfolio
a portfolio made with React, showcasing projects I've worked on thus far in UCLA's Full-Stack Web Development Program* (*: plus the ability to add /edit any additional as I would like in the future)


## Usage

## Description

## Installation
1. node v (already installed, but in best practice always ensure it is installed-- v lets you know what version is installed.)
2. npx install react-create-app . (given that the repository was created beforehand, otherwise,  'npx install react-create-app-<app-name-here>)
3. (this was not in the acceptance criteria, but added additional functionality: npm install react-router-dom)
    this adds router functionality to the navbar links
